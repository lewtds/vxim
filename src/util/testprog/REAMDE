This is a very simple program which demonstrate the I18N, locale, and
XIM supports programming. It also serves as an testing XIM client for
xcin-2.5. For details about how to write a Xi18n program, please read
the document comes with the package:  i18n_prog.tar.gz

	i18n_prog/doc/index.html

If you do not familiar with the I18N and XIM environment and are not
sure if xcin can work correctly in your system, it would be a good
idea to use this program for test. First you should build this program
from the source code. Just go to the top source directory "xcin-2.5/"
and run "configure" program if you haven't run it, and type "make"
to build testprog. After that you can run this program and test it 
with xcin.

By default this program will not be installed into your system. It also
comes with I18N message translation (po files). If you want to have the 
internationalized message output, you should run "make install" in this
directory, then the po files will be installed in the "po/" sub-dir
properly, and you can set the LC_MESSAGES category properly to have the
i18n message output.

For detailed usage description of testprog, please run "testprog -h".
