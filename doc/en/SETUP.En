This article describes the procedure of installation of xcin-2.5:

---------------------------------
A. System requirement:

Because xcin-2.5 is based on the design to support Xi18n and locale, you have
to prepare the I18N and suitable locale environment before installing xcin.
You also need a completed X11R6 system and needed X Window fonts in your 
system.

Currently xcin-2.5 can be installed in GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, and HP-UX systems.
The requirement of these systems are:

1. GNU/Linux:
     a. Need glibc-2.1.x and above (although xcin could also be installed in
	glibc-2.0.x system through some special arrangements, but it might
	introduce many possible problems, so we do not recommand this).
     b. Need gcc-2.7.2 and above.
     c. Need XFree86-3.3.6 and above (although xcin could also be installed in
	all the XFree86-3.3.X systems through some special arrangements, but it
	might introduce many possible problems, so we do not recommand this).
     d. Need suitable locale supports, such as zh_TW.Big5, zh_CN.GB2312 ....
	etc, and their corresponding Chinese fonts. Because not all the 
	GNU/Linux distributions support these locales, if your system does
	not have them, please refer to
	    ftp://xcin.linux.org.tw/pub/xcin/i18n/i18n_tool.tar.gz
	to establish your locale environment.

2. FreeBSD:
     a. FreeBSD-4.0 and above systems which support locale and ELF are 
	recommanded.
     b. Need gcc-2.7.2 and above.
     c. Need XFree86-3.3.6 and above (although xcin could also be installed 
	in all the XFree86-3.3.X systems via some special arrangements, but 
	it might introduce many possible problems, so it is not recommanded).
     d. Need suitable locale supports, such as zh_TW.Big5, zh_CN.EUC .... etc,
	and their corresponding Chinese fonts.

3. HP-UX:
     a. HP-UX B.10.XX and above systems are recommanded.
     b. Need ANSI C compiler.
     c. Need suitable locale supports, such as zh_TW.big5, zh_HK.hkbig5 .... 
	etc, and their cooresponding Chinese fonts.


---------------------------------
B. Install xcin-2.5:

1. Berkeley DB2:
   If you want to install bimsphone module when installing xcin-2.5, then you
   need Berkeley DB2, otherwise you don't. Please note that if you do not want
   to install bimsphone, you have to add the "--disable-bimsphone" option when
   configuring xcin (see below), then the configure procedure will not check
   the existence of Berkeley DB2.

   If your system is GNU/Linux with glibc-2.1.X, the system already contains
   Berkeley DB2, so you don't need to install it. If your system do not have
   it, you can find it in the following:

	http://www.sleepycat.com
	ftp://xcin.linux.org.tw/pub/xcin/misc/db-2.7.4.tar.gz

2. libtabe:
   Beginning from xcin-2.5.1, libtabe is separated from xcin package and will 
   be maintained independently. If you want to install bimsphone module when 
   installing xcin-2.5, then you also need libtabe, otherwise you don't.
   Please note that if you do not want to install bimsphone, you have to add 
   the "--disable-bimsphone" option when configuring xcin (see below), then 
   the configure procedure will not check the existence of libtabe.

   You can find the stable libtabe package in

	ftp://xcin.linux.org.tw/pub/xcin/libtabe/libtabe-<version>.tar.gz

   or the under-development version in

	ftp://xcin.linux.org.tw/pub/xcin/libtabe/devel/libtabe-<version>.tar.gz

   Please note that since xcin develops with libtabe, so different versions
   of xcin need their corresponding versions libtabe. To be clearly, you will
   always find the correct version of libtabe package in the same directory
   of the ftp site where you download the xcin package. For example, if you
   are going to install the stable version of xcin, please also install the
   libtabe package found in:

	ftp://xcin.linux.org.tw/pub/xcin/xcin/libtabe-<version>.tar.gz

   On the other hand if you are planing to install the newest under-development
   version of xcin, please also install the newest version of libtabe found in:

	ftp://xcin.linux.org.tw/pub/xcin/xcin/devel/libtabe-<version>.tar.gz

   For the correct version of libtabe for this xcin version, please see the
   description of section C in the "README" file.

   If your system has the support to shared library, it is recommanded to
   compile libtabe to be the shared library. In the following is the quick 
   installation guide (see the documents in libtabe for details):

	gzip -dc libtabe-<version>.tar.gz | tar -xvf -
	cd libtabe
	./configure --prefix=<path> --enable-shared
	make install

3. GNU Gettext:
   Under GNU/Linux and FreeBSD systems, if you want to have the i18n message 
   displaying facility of xcin, you have to install GNU Gettext package. 
   Otherwise you don't need.

4. The source code of stable version of xcin is available in:

	ftp://xcin.linux.org.tw/pub/xcin/xcin/

   If you want to have the newest testing version, you can find them in:

	ftp://xcin.linux.org.tw/pub/xcin/xcin/devel/

   The package name of xcin is usually: xcin-<version>.tar.gz, where <version>
   is the version number. If you see the "pre" word or the date number in it, 
   then it should be the testing version, otherwise it should be the stable
   version. When you get the version you want, please unpack it through the
   following command:

	gzip -dc xcin-<version>.tar.gz | tar -xvf -

   After that you will get a xcin-2.5/ directory.

5. Change to xcin-2.5 directory and run configure program. Generally speaking,
   if the extra libraries (such as Berkeley DB2, libtabe .... etc) needed by
   xcin are all placed in the same position of the system, you only need to
   excute:

	 ./configure --prefix=<installation path> \
		     --with-extra-prefix=<path of extra libraries>

   In addition, configure program can accept other options, as described in
   the following:

	--help
	    Print the usage message.

	--prefix=PATH (default is /usr/local)
	    Set the installation path to PATH, then xcin will be installed in
	    the following directories,

		excutables:  $PATH/bin
		data files:  $PATH/lib/xcin
		configuration files:  $PATH/etc

	--binpath=PATH (default is ${prefix}/bin)
	    Set the installation path of xcin excutables to PATH.

	--with-xcin-dir=PATH (default is ${prefix}/lib/xcin)
	    Set the installation path of xcin data files to PATH.

	--with-xcin-rcdir=PATH (default is ${prefix}/etc)
	    Set the installation path of xcin configuration files to PATH.

	--with-localedir=PATH (default is ${prefix}/share/locale)
	    Set the path of the system locale directory. It is used to install
	    xcin LC_MESSAGES mo files.

	--with-extra-prefix=PATH (default is ${prefix})
	    Set the path to the prefix of the extra libraries. Because to 
	    install xcin-2.5 you need extra libraries such as Berkeley DB2, 
	    libtabe, .... etc, if these libraries are available in the same 
	    prefix, instead of setting the paths of these libraries one by 
	    one (see below), you can set their common prefix here, so that 
	    you don't need to type a long option list for configure program.

	    After setting this option, the configure program will set the
	    following two options automatically:

		extra_include=-I$extra_prefix/include
		extra_library=-L$extra_prefix/lib

	    and during the configure and compilation stages, the extra lib
	    and header files will be searched according the above 2 variables.

	--with-extra-inc=PATH (default is ${extra_prefix}/include)
	    Set the common path to the header files of extra libraries.

	--with-extra-lib=PATH (default is ${extra_prefix}/lib)
	    Set the common path to the extra libraries.

	--disable-bimsphone (default is enable)
	    Do not install bimsphone module. Because to install bimsphone
	    module, the Berkeley DB2 and libtabe are needed, and in this 
	    situation the xcin configure program will check these two packages
	    to see if they are available or not. If not the it will just stop
	    and give error messages. Therefore, if you don't want to install
	    bimsphone, you have to add this option when running configure,
	    then it will not check Berkeley DB2 and libtabe, and when 
	    compilation the bimsphone module will not be compiled, either.

	--with-dbinc=PATH (default is ${extra_include})
	    Set the path to the header files of Berkeley DB2 as PATH.

	--with-dblib=PATH (default is ${extra_library})
	    Set the path to Berkeley DB2 library as PATH.

	--with-tabeinc=PATH (default is ${extra_include})
	    Set the path to the header files of libtabe as PATH.

	--with-tabelib=PATH (default is ${extra_library})
	    Set the path to libtabe as PATH.

	--with-intlinc=PATH (default is ${extra_include})
	    Set the path to the header files of libintl as PATH (for gettext).

	--with-intllib=PATH (default is ${extra_library})
	    Set the path to libintl as PATH.

	--x-includes=PATH (no defaults)
	    Set the path to the header files of the X Window system.

	--x-libraries=PATH (no defaults)
	    Set the path to the libraries of X Window system.

	--enable-debug
	    Enable the debug options.

6. Start the compilation:
	make
	make install

7. Modify the contents of $RCPATH/xcinrc according to your locale environment:

   Generally speaking, for GNU/Linux, FreeBSD or HP-UX systems, the default 
   settings in xcinrc are valid to work, so you don't need to do extra 
   modification. But for other UNIX systems, the locale environment and the
   needed X Window fonts might be different. So some modifications are needed
   in this situation. For details about the xcinrc setting please refer to 
   Usage and modules/* documents.

8. Extra notes for various UNIX platform:

   HP-UX:
	The default xmodmap configuration in HP-UX CDE environment might 
	cause some functional keys of xcin to be fault. Please check the 
	following: Run xmodmap command and note the value of "mod1" printed. 
	If you see
		mod1        Meta_L (0x22),  Meta_R (0x42),  Mode_switch (0x84)

	then you have to run
		xmodmap -e "remove mod1 = Mode_switch"

	to unset the Mode_switch. In other words, only keep the Meta_L and
	Meta_R settings. You can put this command in suiable place such that 
	everytime when you login into CDE environment, this command will be
	excuted automatically. For details please read the man page of xmodmap
	and your CDE documentations.

9. If you cannot find your favorite input method tables in $XCINPATH/tab/,
   please refer to Cin document to prepare for your .cin file.
