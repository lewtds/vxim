In this article the detailed procedure to start xcin and XIM clients is
described. For the detailed usage and the configurations in xcinrc, please
refer to the document "Usage".

-----------------------------
A. Start xcin and XIM client:

XCIN-2.5 is a XIM server, so it can only input Chinese characters into XIM
clients. Hence when you are going to test it, please be sure that you are
using the XIM client to accept the input from it. Some of the detailed 
operations of several popular XIM clients are described in section B. Here 
we will use the "testprog" program provided by the xcin-2.5 package as an 
example to describe the over all procedures.

Generally speaking, there are 4 steps to start XIM server (i.e., xcin) and
the XIM client:

1. Setting locale:

   The "locale" stands for the local language environment of your system.
   You can set it up through the settings of the environment variables.
   First you have to make sure the locale name of your system, and use it
   in the following settings. You can use the command "locale -a" or just
   look into the contents of the directory /usr/share/locale to determine
   the correct locale name of your system.

   A usual locale name contains a definite format as following:

	<language name>_<local area name>.<encoding name>

   The the Big5 environment usually used in Taiwan area as an example, the
   locale name might be a little different in different operating systems.
   The following is a simple list:

	GNU/Linux and FreeBSD:		zh_TW.Big5
	HP-UX:				zh_TW.big5

   where "zh" stands for "Chinese language", "TW" stands for the Taiwan area,
   and "Big5" or "big5" stands for Big5 character set/encoding. Similarly,
   for the GB2312 character set/encoding used in Mainland China, the locale
   name is

	GNU/Linux:			zh_CN.GB2312

   Please note that because currently xcin only supports the following
   character set/encoding:

	Big5, GB2312, Big5HKSCS (Big5 + Hong Kong extension), GBK

   so you should not choose the locale name with unsupported encoding name,
   such as "zh_TW.utf8". The unsupported name cannot work under xcin.


   After deciding the correct locale name you want, you can begin to set
   the locale. In the following we take "zh_TW.Big5" locale as an example.
   There are many ways to do the setting. The simplest one is running these
   command under a X Window terminal

   (under sh, ksh, or bash)
	LANG=zh_TW.Big5; export LANG
   (under csh or tcsh)
	setenv LANG zh_TW.Big5

   then in this terminal, the whole language environment is changed to 
   zh_TW.Big5, including character set handling (LC_CTYPE), message output
   (LC_MESSAGES) and other aspects. From now on every program running under
   this termiinal will operate under the zh_TW.Big5 locale as long as it
   support the I18N standard.

   If you do not want to switch the whole language environment to zh_TW.Big5,
   but only want to switch the most important part while the other parts
   remain in the English environment, you can set like this:

   (under sh, ksh, or bash)
	LC_CTYPE=zh_TW.Big5; export LC_CTYPE
   (under csh or tcsh)
	setenv LC_CTYPE zh_TW.Big5

   This way only the character set handling part will be switched, which 
   should be the kernel part of the all. If you want an I18N program to have
   the Big5 character set handling ability, you have to setup this part.

   Furthermore, if you want the message output of the program to be Big5
   Chinese, you should also set

   (under sh, ksh, or bash)
	LC_MESSAGES=zh_TW.Big5; export LC_MESSAGES
   (under csh or tcsh)
	setenv LC_MESSAGES zh_TW.Big5

   You can also add the above commands into your $HOME/.profile (for sh, ksh,
   or bash) or $HOME/.cshrc (for csh or tcsh), then everytime you login these
   commands will be excuted automatically instead of you running them manually.


2. Run xcin program. If success, you will see the following message:

============================================================================
XCIN (Chinese XIM server) version xcin <version number>.
(module ver: <version number>, syscin ver: <version number>).
(use "-h" option for help)

xcin: locale "zh_TW.Big5" encoding "big5"
xcin: XIM server "xcin" transport "X/"
xcin: inp_styles: Root OverTheSpot 
============================================================================

   Please note the last 2 lines and the words inside the quotation. They may
   be different depending on the locale setting in the previous step. And
   they are also the hints to start the XIM clients. The meaning of each
   fields are:

	locale: The locale name when start up. Here the value is "zh_TW.Big5".

	encoding: The encoding name of this locale.

	XIM server: This is the <XIM server name> of xcin, and as shown in
		the message the name is "xcin". Every XIM server will have
		a unique name to make the connection with the XIM clients.
		Please note that depending on the locale setting when start
		up, the value of <XIM server name> will be different.

	transport: The name of the connecting method between XIM server/client.

	inp_styles: The input styles supported by xcin. As shown in the above,
		xcin start up with 2 kinds of input styles, i.e., Root and
		OverTheSpot. The XIM client can choose one of them to make
		the connection. You can decide which input styles to be brought
		up by the configurations in the xcinrc file. Please refer to
		the document "Usage" for details.


3. Before starting the XIM client, you have to set this environment variable:

   (under sh, ksh, or bash)
	XMODIFIERS="@im=<name>"; export XMODIFIERS
   (under csh or tcsh)
	setenv XMODIFIERS "@im=<name>"

   where <name> is the <XIM server name> as described in the above. Take the
   example of the above, you should have the setting as

   (under sh, ksh, or bash)
	XMODIFIERS="@im=xcin"; export XMODIFIERS
   (under csh or tcsh)
	setenv XMODIFIERS "@im=xcin"

   The actual setting value depends on the message you see when starting xcin.
   Of course, if you can expect what the message of xcin will be, you can
   also write the above commands into $HOME/.profile or $HOME/.cshrc such
   that they can be excuted automatically when login.

4. Now you can start the XIM client. Please note that some XIM clients might
   not be so clever to determine the correct input style to make the connection
   with xcin. If this happens you have to assign the correct input style to
   the client according to the document of it.


Now we take the "testprog" provided in xcin-2.5 package as the example to
demonstrate the above procedures. This is a very simple XIM client for test.
You can find it under "xcin-2.5/src/util/testprog/" directory. If it is not
compiled yet, please type "make" to build it up. If we want to use the
"zh_TW.Big5" locale, we can excute the following commands under bash:

        LC_CTYPE=zh_TW.Big5; export LC_CTYPE
        xcin &
        XMODIFIERS="@im=xcin"; export XMODIFIERS
        ./testprog -fontset "-*-big5-0,-*-iso8859-1"

On the other hand, if we want to use "zh_CN.GB2312", the needed comands are

        LC_CTYPE=zh_CN.GB2312; export LC_CTYPE
        xcin &
        XMODIFIERS="@im=xcin-zh_CN.GB2312"; export XMODIFIERS
        ./testprog -fontset "-*-gb2312.1980-0,-*-iso8859-1"

For the detailed usage of testprog, you can run

	testprog -h

and it will print the following messages

========================================================================
Use "-h" option to see help.
Usage: testprog -fontset <fontset> -im <im_name> -pt <im_style>
Example:
  export LC_CTYPE=<locale name>.
  export LC_MESSAGES=<locale name>.
  export XMODIFIERS="@im=<im_name>".
  zh_TW.Big5 fontset: "-*-big5-0,-*-iso8859-1".
  zh_CN.GB2312 fontset: "-*-gb2312.1980-0,-*-iso8859-1".
========================================================================

For the other XIM client, the start up procedures are very similar, so we will
not repeat them again. In the following some details of several common used
XIM clients are described.


---------------------------------------
B. Some details of several XIM clients:

In the following we only list the clients which we really tested, but there
should be many other XIM clients in the world. If you have experience on other
XIM clients, it is welcome to provide us your information, and we are very
appreciated to list them in this list.

1. xedit:
****************************
   Please add the following lines into your $HOME/.Xresources:

xtDefaultFontSet: -*-big5-0,-adobe-*-iso8859-1
xedit*international: True
xedit*fontSet: -*-16-*-big5-1, -adobe-*-16-*-iso8859-1
.Xedit.shellext.inputMethod:    xcin
.Xedit.shellext.preeditType:    Root

   and run "xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources" or reenter X Window system. Then use
   the procedures described in section A to start xcin and xedit.


2. rxvt-2.6.x/2.7.x:
****************************
   You can find the rxvt in

	ftp://ftp.rxvt.org/pub/rxvt/
	ftp://xcin.linux.org.tw/pub/xcin/rxvt/

   The compiling procedures are:

   For rxvt-2.6.x:
        a. configure --enable-xim --enable-big5
        b. make

   For rxvt-2.7.x:
        a. configure --enable-languages --enable-xim
        b. make

   Then use the procedures described in section A to start xcin and rxvt.
   You might need the following options when starting rxvt:

   For rxvt-2.6.x:
        rxvt -pt Root -fm <Chinese font name> -fn <English font name>

   For rxvt-2.7.x:
        rxvt -pt Root -fm <Chinese font name> -fn <English font name> \
		-km <encoding name>

	where the <encoding name> could be "big5" or "gb".

   Most of the rxvt options can also be written in $HOME/.Xresources. For
   details please refer to the documents provided by rxvt package.

   PS. RXVT still has several problems to be fixed. For details please refer
       to http://xcin.linux.org.tw/rxvt/


3. netscape-4.5/4.6/4.7:
************************
   Please add the following lines into your $HOME/.Xresources:

Netscape*useStderrDialog:  False
Netscape*preeditType:  Root
Netscape*fontList: \
        -*-helvetica-bold-r-*-120-*-iso8859-1;-*-big5-0:
Netscape*XmLGrid*fontList: \
        -*-helvetica-medium-r-*-120-*-iso8859-1;-*-big5-0:,\
        -*-helvetica-bold-r-*-120-*-iso8859-1;-*-big5-0:=BOLD,\
        -*-helvetica-medium-o-*-120-*-iso8859-1;-*-big5-0:=ITALIC

   and excute "xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources" or reenter X Window system. Then
   use the procedures described in section A to start xcin and netscape.


4. XEmacs20:
****************************
   Here we use the xemacs20 package provided by Debian-2.1 as the example.
   In the Debian distribution there are 3 major xemacs20 packages:

	xemacs20-mule-canna-wnn_<version>.deb
	xemacs20-mule_<version>.deb
	xemacs20-nomule_<version>.deb

   You have to choose one of them to install. According to the description
   of these packages, the 1st one supports international character display,
   and also support the input methods of Asian languages, including XIM.
   The 2nd one only supports international character display, but does not
   support any input methods of Asian languages. The 3rd one does not have
   any support for internationalization. Because xcin-2.5 use XIM protocol,
   so we have to choose the 1st package (which have the --with-xim=xlib
   option when configure/compiling). Of course, to install the 1st package
   you also need to install other related packages. Please see

	dpkg --info xemacs20-mule-canna-wnn_20.4-13.deb

   for details. For the other non-Debian systems, I think the methods are
   very similar. If you build xemacs from the source code by yourself, please
   remember to add the --with-xim=xlib option when configure. The "mule"
   package (the internationalization support) might also needed if necessary.
   If you are using RPM based distributions or FreeBSD, you have to choose
   the xemacs with mule or XIM supports to install.

   If your xemacs has been installed correctly, then the remaining thing
   to do is just do some configurations. You can add this line into
   $HOME/.Xresources for Big5 environment:

Emacs*FontSet: -*-big5-0,-adobe-*-iso8859-1

   and run "xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources" or reenter X Window system. Then use
   the procedures described in section A to start xcin and xemacs. Now you
   can press trigger keys (default is ctrl+space) to switch to the Chinese
   input mode, but the characters you input are still not displayed correctly.
   Then you can use the mouse to choose the following menus:

	Mule -> Set language environment -> Chinese-BIG5

   so that the problem could be solved.



If you have experience on other XIM clients, please tell us. We are very
appreciated to share your experience with others.
